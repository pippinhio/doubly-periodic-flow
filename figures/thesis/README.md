All figures in my thesis<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> were created by Python scripts. 

The scripts create the plotted data from scratch. Usually that only takes a few seconds.
If computing the data takes longer, we provide too files: One that creates the data (`_dat`) and one that plots it (`_fig`).
