All figures in my thesis were created by Python scripts. The only exception is the photograph of cilia in the introduction. 

The scripts create the plotted data from scratch. Usually that only takes a few seconds.
If computing the data takes longer, we provide too files: One that creates the data (`_dat`) and one that plots it (`_fig`).
