# A Numerical Method for Doubly-Periodic Stokes Flow in 3D with and without a Bounding Plane

In my PhD thesis ([add link]) I developed a fast numerical method to compute Stokes flow in 3D that is periodic in two directions.
This repo contains my implementation.

* If you want to recreate the data and figures from my thesis, have a look into the [figures/thesis](figures/thesis) folder.

* If you want to use the code for your fluid problem, a good start is [example.py](example.py) and the comments therein. 
Start exploring by simply running `python2.7 example.py`.

Make sure you're using Python 2.7 with the following packages installed:
* numpy 1.9.1,
* matplotlib 1.4.3,
* scipy 0.9.0.
